# String Matching Algorithm
Principles and Paradigms of Programming Project.


**How to Clone the Repository**
To simply clone (download) the repoistory to gain access to all the files, just open up your command terminal and run the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Montaser-Taher/-string-matching/tree/main
```
This will open up a navigation explorer. Simply place the folder into any directory you wish.


# Python File 
To run the python program of the project, open up a command prompt/terminal and change the directory to the project's folder.
i.e
```
cd path/to/directory/-string-matching
```
Once done, assuming you have your python environment added to your PATH environment variables, run the following command
```
python stringMatch.py
```
This will run the python file.


# C# File
To run the C# Version of the algorithm, open up the command prompt/terminal and repeat the process of changing your terminal to the project folder.

To run a C# program, you will have to use the command
```
csc
```
running this make the prompt reveal a version of your installed C# Compiler.
**Note: If you get an error that says "csc is not recognized  as an internal or external command". It is because you did not add your C# Compiler to the PATH environment variable.**

To fix this for windows, you'll have to open the start menu and search "Edit the system environment variables". This will open a window, to which you should
see at the very bottom "Environment Variables...".

1) Click on "Path" under "User Variables" and click "Edit".
2) Click on "New" and copy and paste the directory of your C# Compiler into the path (This would look like **C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319 ASSUMING YOU HAVE ALREADY INSTALLED THE .NET Package**)

3) After doing so, simply exit by clicking "ok" and attempt to run the C# file as per initial instructions.
